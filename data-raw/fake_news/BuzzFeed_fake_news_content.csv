Fake_1-Webpage,Proof The Mainstream Media Is Manipulating The Election By Taking Bill Clinton Out Of Context,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:

Bill Clinton: ‘Natural’ For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Here’s Google:

Naturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”

Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

“It was natural for people who’ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn’t do anything they shouldn’t do,” Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.

Now, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.” Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

Fake_10-Webpage,Charity: Clinton Foundation Distributed “Watered-Down” AIDS Drugs to Sub-Saharan Africa – Eagle Rising,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

“When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”

“Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

“These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.

Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”

Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”

“In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.

“You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

Fake_11-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

Fake_12-Webpage,Trump’s Latest Campaign Promise May Be His Most Horrible One Yet,"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He’s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned “rapists” and “drug dealers” from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a “temporary measure.” He’s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

“The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don’t kid yourself. When they say they don’t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.”

But he’s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald’s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism — he’s fighting the “narratives” of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump’s “narrative” is “kill them all”:

Last weekend’s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama’s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we’re in more than a fight about ‘narratives’ – these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: “They must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.”

Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is “radical Islamic terrorism,” and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating “terrorists?”

“They’re protecting each other, but they’re really doing very bad damage — they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,” Trump said in March. “When they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that’s a big problem.”

If Muslims are “protecting” terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump’s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists’ families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself — but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents’ security to “see what happens” to them (shortly after suggesting that “Second Amendment People” could deal with them. We’re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‘little red button’ that launches our nuclear arsenal.

It’s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen — one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He’s said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation — to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it’s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

Fake_14-Webpage,Obama Pushes One World Government,"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world. Also in the speech he referred to “true democracy.” If that is what he is for, then God help us.

As Written By Alex Pfeiffer for Daily Caller:

‘Collision of cultures’

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led “to a collision of cultures” but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

“I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,” Obama said. “In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.”

The president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and “the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.” Obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought…..",http://allenwestrepublic.com/2016/09/20/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg,,http://allenwestrepublic.com,{'$date': 1474329600000},,"http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/615163699414745088/hUr8iaHP_normal.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18929-featured-300x130.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18919-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama-1120x588.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18943-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18952-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18957-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18958-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18926-featured-300x130.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18939-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18925-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18938-featured-300x130.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18935-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/allenwestrepublic_site_logo-2.png,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18914-featured-300x130.jpg,http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg",http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Allen West Republic"", ""description"": ""God help us"", ""title"": ""Obama Pushes One World Government"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 648, ""identifier"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg"", ""height"": 351}, ""url"": ""http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""robots"": ""noimageindex"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 444516555706636}, ""article"": {""section"": ""Barack Hussein Obama"", ""tag"": ""United Nations"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-20T21:05:31-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/AllenWestRepublic""}, ""viewport"": ""initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no""}"
Fake_15-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Fake_16-Webpage,WHOA! NEW DISTURBING VIDEO Shows HILLARY'S Campaign Likely FAKED Her Audience At NC Rally * 100percentfedUp.com,"On September 15, Hillary “apparently” held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary’s campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea’s apartment following her “incident,” passing more than one hospital on the way to “recuperate.” Did Hillary recover from her “incident” or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?

Here is the first video of Hillary’s Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask “what the heck are those cameras in Hillary’s ‘audience’ pointing at?” If you look closely, it sure isn’t Hillary!

Watch this video first, and then the video below to get a closer analysis of what appears to be a phony rally for Hillary at

This stunning video takes the viewer through and shows step-by-step where the audience is faked:

Fake_17-Webpage,Is it the Beginning of the End for Hillary Clinton? – Eagle Rising,"I can’t wait for “Weekend at Chelsea’s” to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton’s slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups – these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low – would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a “minor setback” to her “inevitable” victory.

The American people aren’t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more “conspiracy theory” dismissals. Mrs. Clinton’s “mild cold,” er, “seasonal allergies,” I mean “heat exhaustion,” that is to say “minor case of pneumonia” is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a “mystery man” who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable “episodes” (or otherwise freezes up with a brain “short-circuit” during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease – a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has “pneumonia” required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won’t, but they should. I wonder what official “diagnosis” we’ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they’ve been there a hundred times before. “Nothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton’s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‘powered through’ yesterday going door-to-door.”

The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She’s proven, yet again, that she can’t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She’s a liar. That’s her default mode. She’s corrupt. And she’s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else – including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton’s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. “Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice” (Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “racist” and “irredeemable” “basket of deplorables,” has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement – especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her “friend and mentor.” Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags – the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Who’s the racist?

I’m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can’t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

It’s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she’s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she’s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, “Many are the plans in a person’s heart, but it is the LORD’s purpose that prevails.”

Am I saying there’s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there’s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton’s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector – a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

When they visit her in prison.

Fake_19-Webpage,Obama Just DISGRACED The U.S. By Surrendering To ISIS In Front Of Entire U.N. ⋆ US Herald,"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""

Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.

""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.

President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""

He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.""

Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""

Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.

It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.

It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.

It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.

Fake_2-Webpage,Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' ⋆ US Herald,"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.

According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ‘Islamic State’ in Iraq and Syria.”

Obviously Obama’s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a “JV” team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.

However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.

However what isn’t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

Here is a link to the Judicial Watch press release detailing the released documents.

Fake_20-Webpage,A Hillary Clinton Administration May be Entirely Run by a FIGUREHEAD – Eagle Rising,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

Fake_21-Webpage,BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?,"BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?

Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it’s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton’s schedule.

Interesting fact….I just searched Hillary Clinton’s rally events scheduled between September 20 – October 19 – She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn’t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!

There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I’m no expert. However I am a realist.

I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton’s left hand.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.

Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn’t appear to want to be president any longer.

No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.

As for Hillary Clinton’s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won’t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the “conspirators.”

Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.

Expect lots more on this to surface over the next few days.",http://theblacksphere.net/2016/09/breaking-did-hillary-clinton-have-a-nervous-breakdown/,http://theblacksphere.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/wikileaks-identifies-parents-of-e1474455470249-1200x630.jpg,Kevin Jackson,http://theblacksphere.net,{'$date': 1474455643000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/x72oBpk9WPI,"http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hillary-helped-up-stairs-610x641.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42879-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Obama-with-other-Democrats-600x260.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42875-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/21234-featured-300x130.jpeg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42859-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Podesta-and-Putin-640x480-600x260.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Donald-Trump-Thumb-Up-Reuters-600x260.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/The-Black-Sphere_Logo_Web.png,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42836-featured-300x130.jpg,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42862-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42873-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42857-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mattissittingdown-600x260.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42853-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/15248-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/tribute-flag-shirt2.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42841-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/download.png,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Russian-embarrasses-CNN-600x260.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42884-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/36088-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42846-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/wikileaks-identifies-parents-of-e1474455470249-1200x630.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1604950746428137&ev=PixelInitialized,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42871-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/42883-featured-300x130.jpg,http://theblacksphere.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/15068-featured-300x130.jpg",http://theblacksphere.net/2016/09/breaking-did-hillary-clinton-have-a-nervous-breakdown/,"{""description"": ""Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

Fake_22-Webpage,Hillary Denies She and Obama Founded ISIS…Then This Video Shows Up,"It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn’t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he’d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.

First, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn’t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals’ butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn’t. He peeked into people’s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns’ desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?

It wasn’t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music — the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans — and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they’d seen. (“Hey, bro, it’s the president!” “Yeah, bro!”) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word “ISIS” came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He’d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.

At first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn’t kidding. “I want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,” he’d tell them. They’d laugh and say something like, “Hey, Mr. President, please don’t ever say that again publicly!” Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.

They were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other’s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, “Is it about how you’re really a terrorist?” He looked at her and said, “Yes, actually.” She stopped eating her Popsicle. “Donald Trump was right about you?” He nodded. “About everything.”

He explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He’d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (“Honestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.”) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.

“Isn’t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?” Hillary asked. Obama nodded. “Kind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.”

No one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn’t know what had given it away. He’d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? “Wait, what?” Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo’s eyes were really tiny LED screens. “Did you know that when Bo barks,” Obama said, “he’s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?”

Hillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. “You’re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?” Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, “I feel like I’m short-circuiting!” Obama did his best to comfort her. “Bo does that sometimes. Then he’ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.”

Hillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman’s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. “I’m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,” Hillary apologized. “Do you mean a fin?” Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: “But I haven’t even told you the best part yet. I’m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.”

“Isis?”

“No, ISIS. All caps.”

Hillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn’t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he’d be. He told her “like for real” they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.

He was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, “We’ll wait until I’m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.” Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn’t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to “Wonderwall” as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair. Pretty soon, it was morning again.",,,,,,,,,{}
Fake_23-Webpage,Trump Just Made A Campaign Promise So Ridiculous It Makes ‘Read My Lips’ Look Good ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016

We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education.

It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

Fake_24-Webpage,Top Army Chief of Staff General Has Had It With Obama Incompetence ⋆ US Herald,"With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno believes we’ve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.

Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; “The Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""

However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president’s astounding incompetence, there’s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.

The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""

The Army has cut 80,000 soldiers out of the active force, reorganized and cut 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades from the active component. Investment in modernization is down by 25%, Odierno said, sidelining ""much-needed"" infantry fighting vehicle modernization and a scout helicopter development program.",http://usherald.com/top-army-chief-of-staff-general-has-had-it-with-obama-incompetence?utm_source=aep&utm_medium=generalobamaincompetent&utm_campaign=fbext,http://usherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/post_1428850208.jpg,Bob Amoroso,http://usherald.com,{'$date': 1429715433000},,"http://usherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/usherald-logo.png,http://usherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/post_14288502081.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=718459264928386&ev=PixelInitialized,http://usherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/post_1428850208.jpg",http://usherald.com/top-army-chief-of-staff-general-has-had-it-with-obama-incompetence/,"{""generator"": ""WordPress 4.8.1"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""US Herald"", ""description"": ""With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army \u2026"", ""title"": ""Top Army Chief of Staff General Has Had It With Obama Incompetence \u22c6 US Herald"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 640, ""identifier"": ""http://usherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/post_1428850208.jpg"", ""height"": 360}, ""updated_time"": ""2015-11-09T14:07:15-05:00"", ""url"": ""http://usherald.com/top-army-chief-of-staff-general-has-had-it-with-obama-incompetence/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army [\u2026]"", ""creator"": ""@usheraldnews"", ""image"": ""http://usherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/post_1428850208.jpg"", ""title"": ""Top Army Chief of Staff General Has Had It With Obama Incompetence \u22c6 US Herald"", ""site"": ""@usheraldnews"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""fb"": {""app_id"": 211561922608080, ""pages"": 1746057572287188}, ""article"": {""publisher"": ""https://www.facebook.com/unitedstatesherald/"", ""section"": ""US NEWS"", ""published_time"": ""2015-04-22T10:10:33-05:00"", ""modified_time"": ""2015-11-09T14:07:15-05:00""}, ""google-site-verification"": ""ZdE3006b76rd8x4CyNxQi3cdpRirnUjvfut4ZYX-bqY"", ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0""}"
Fake_25-Webpage,Congress MUST Act! Five Days Until Obama's Internet Giveaway [Video],"What would possess anyone to take control of the Internet away from the United States and put it under control of ICANN, composed of 182 foreign countries? That cannot bode well for freedom of speech, thought, and ideas. Senator Ted Cruz leads the fight in these videos. Congress MUST ACT NOW!

As Written By Senator Ted Cruz:

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they don’t like.



Right now, the Obama administration’s proposal to give away the Internet is an extraordinary threat to our freedom and it’s one that many Americans don’t know anything about. It is scheduled to go into effect September 30, 2016. Congress must act before it’s too late!

Fake_26-Webpage,Clemson BANS Memes Featuring Dead Gorilla Harambe…Promotes “Rape Culture” and “Racism” – Eagle Rising,"Clemson University freshmen may no longer publicly display Harambe-related memes because they “add to rape culture” and can be “a form of racism.”

The ban was allegedly inspired by an incident that occurred last week, but administrators are refusing to divulge any details.

A Clemson administrator sent an email to Resident Advisors (RAs) Friday instructing them to demand that freshman remove all Harambe references from dorm hallways and windows.

The administrator claimed Harambe’s death has been used to “add to rape culture” and can be “form of racism.” An RA further added that any student who disobeys these instructions will be “in trouble.”

“All Harambe references are no longer allowed within our community.”

“We are no longer allowing any reference to Harambe (or any other spelling) to be displayed on doors, halls, billboards, or windows,” the instructions state. “Harambe should not be displayed in a public place or a place that is viewed by the public…

Fake_27-Webpage,How Democrats are Going to Try to STEAL the Election for Hillary – Eagle Rising,"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a “powerful hate group,” has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.

[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America’s Most Powerful HATE Group

As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author’s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get “Hillary the Horrible” into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.

A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone – especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President – to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.

The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters – but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens – to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.

Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.

Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America’s most powerful “Hate Group,” not only wants “Hillary the Horrible” to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.

Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

Fake_28-Webpage,"“If You Can’t Run Your Own House, You Certainly Can’t Run the White House” – Eagle Rising","A Daisy of a Rerun

I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.

The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson “approved” that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly “war mongering” opponent, Barry Goldwater.

Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson’s deceitful war policies, Goldwater’s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation’s media.

I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.

Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a “Daisy” remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.

Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater’s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.

Instead, today’s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as “news and views.” With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media’s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.

Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted’s “dramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.” This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral.”

As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of “’Lyin Ted,’ insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.” These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.

Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?

Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say “derogatory” when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the “liberal press” moniker has now everyday acceptance.

It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public’s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.

Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and résumés of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.

These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.

With that, consider the President’s past considerations of today’s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, “She will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can’t be trusted and isn’t qualified to be President.”

Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it’s damning, given the time frame.

Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: “If you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House.”

Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.

Again, wouldn’t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

Fake_29-Webpage,CNN’s Post-Debate Rigged Poll Busted…Here Are The Real Results,"We’re shocked — SHOCKED — to learn that CNN’s bias is so blatant in just about everything they do, not simply in reporting the news.

First came Lester Holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked Donald Trump’s record and answers while leaving Hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Not to be outdone, NBC followed up with a similar poll in which there were 14% more Democrats than Republicans.",,,,,,,,,{}
Fake_3-Webpage,Why is it “RACIST” to Question Someone’s Birth Certificate? – Eagle Rising,"The Democrats are using an intimidation tactic which they are prone to use incessantly. If you question the veracity of a black president’s birth certificate you are racist. That is the outright claim of Lynn Sweet Washington Bureau Chief for the Chicago Sun-Times made on Fox News. Consider the slanted claim that if a president is black and his birth certificate is called into question the conclusion is you must be a racist. What is wrong with this obvious non-sequitur?

First of all, there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered. This is discounted by the claims that whoever presented this must be racist. Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there. Third, the hospital that issued his birth certificate in Hawaii didn’t exist when it was “issued.” Fourth, an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification. Has an unquestioned birth certificate ever been presented? No, only a cry of racism when the request is made. They can’t produce an original document and they then rely on the smear of “birther” and racism to substantiate that which they can produce no physical evidence of. Sadly, Donald Trump has bowed to their…

Fake_30-Webpage,"Homosexual Thinks Muslims Will Accept Him, Instantly Learns How They Deal With LGBT","Once again, the “religion of peace” has proven to be neither peaceful nor tolerant — but don’t tell that to political leaders across Europe. They wouldn’t listen anyway.

In May of 2016, Aaron Woods, a homosexual, was the target of a truly “homophobic” attack, according to Brighton & Hove News.

“The victim, a 26-year-old from Eastbourne, was approached by a man who used homophobic language before being punched in the face and suffering a broken jaw,” Sussex police reported.

According to the victim’s friend, Brian Markintosh, when Woods was being attacked, the assailant “was shouting all this Muslim stuff … Aaron was in so much pain. He was really screaming.”

""Gay-Bashing"" Incident

“He’s such a gentle giant. He’s the kindest person you could imagine — this geezer broke his jaw with a knuckleduster. He was filming the young gay guys,” Markintosh added.

Near the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with Woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.

“I am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in Brighton over the last two weekends,” Sgt. Peter Allan said. “I am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.”

No matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their “religion of peace,” right?

Wrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.

Many American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society’s moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. But in the end, radical Islam and the gay community cannot “co-exist” — which is exactly what Aaron Woods learned, to his sorrow.",,,,,,,,,{}
Fake_31-Webpage,REVEALED! Minnesota Mall Attacker ID'd As One Of Hillary's Somali Muslim Refugees,"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.

The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.

The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.

Dahir Adan
Dahir Adan
St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.

On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.

Adan’s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.

Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist’s family.

The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an “accomplished student” in high school (but of course).


Jason Falconer
Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department
St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who “happened to be in the right place at the right time.”

Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That’s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.
Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.

Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama’s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.

The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.

“THIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.”

“AMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.”

“AL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.”

In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.

In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.

“PRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.”

“HE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.”

“THEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN – WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,” HE SAID.

In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.

In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.

Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.

U.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years

If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.

Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.

It’s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It’s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.

Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.

Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.

A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.

Don’t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.

Selah.

Fake_32-Webpage,NYC Terrorist Ahmad Rahami Sued Police Department for ‘Religious Persecution’ in 2011! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"196 SHARES Facebook Twitter

For a little over a decade today’s millennials have been described as being part of the “everyone gets a trophy generation.” Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.

Would you believe that the man behind Saturday’s NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of “Islamophobia?” This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.

The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here’s what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):

The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‘selective enforcement’ based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‘baseless’ tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.

No, you’re not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.

Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. “It was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,” Bollwage said, adding, “It had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.”

Rahami’s family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can’t beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.

Welcome to Obama’s America – where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!

Fake_33-Webpage,Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency,"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don’t vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasn’t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we’ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was “Papa” John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees’ hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn’t.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn’t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s. Here’s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that’s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn’t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

“I want to try it,” CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. “We could have a restaurant that’s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.” “With government driving up the cost of labor, it’s driving down the number of jobs,” he says. “You’re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.” “This is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,” says Puzder. “Does it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?” Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He’s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don’t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That’s just the way he is: profits over people.",http://author.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,,http://author.groopspeak.com,,https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxPlxd7yjy0,"http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/groopspeaknews_v2/images/pageflipbg.png,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breakingnews1.jpg,http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f072e9130198dc6fe7f2d500663cd0?s=70&d=mm&r=g",http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,"{""publisher"": ""Groopspeak"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""generator"": ""WordPress 4.6.1"", ""author"": ""admin"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""AddictingInfo"", ""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.  <a href="", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""description"": ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", ""creator"": ""@editor"", ""url"": ""http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/"", ""image"": ""http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg"", ""title"": ""Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency"", ""site"": ""@groopspeak"", ""card"": ""summary_large_image""}, ""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"": ""yes"", ""fb"": {""app_id"": 636595649691481}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0""}"
Fake_34-Webpage,BREAKING: WikiLeaks Releases Proof Hillary Lied and The FBI Covered It Up,"The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin.

Apparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained “tens of thousands of e-mails” from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary’s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.

On July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed “dismay,” and “disgust” with Director Comey’s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.

A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, “It was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton’s] security clearance yanked.”
“It is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,” the senior FBI official told Fox News. “We were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‘but we are doing nothing,’ which made no sense to us.” — Fox News
UPDATE October 17, 2016:
The FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official “pressured” the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton’s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.

The FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called “The Shadow Government” who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that “placed Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ‘her election campaign’”. — BBC News

UPDATE October 25, 2016:
According to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

Uncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta
In September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user “stonetear”, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton’s private e-mail server.

Mr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.


It was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.

Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016
On March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:

From:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015–03–04 20:41 Subject: Special Category
Think we should hold emails to and from potus? That’s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545
In other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton’s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.

UPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up
On March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official’s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server.

They know POTUS and HRC emailed. Josh has been asked about that. Standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email, so his answer to press was that he would not comment/confirm. I recollect that Josh was also asked if POTUS ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like POTUS likely had better things to do than focus on his Cabinet’s email addresses.

I find it odd the NYT didn’t actually quote the President saying what’s in their headline. Especially since the story has a disbelieving tone to his not noticing. One of us should connect with the WH just so they know that the email will show his statement to not make sense. I’m happy to do so to Josh Earnest since Jen is in a weird position, unless Cheryl or John you want to (or already have) with someone else. But it’s not unreasonable to assume that Josh is going to get asked how this was possible, and he should have the factset. Especially if it’s some weird technical thing with the President’s email setup that he doesn’t see addresses. — https://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/21779
To make matters even worse for the cover up, in another leaked e-mail, Erika Rottenberg, another Clinton attorney, admits Hillary Clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.

I know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren’t satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I’ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc. — https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099
The reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.

However, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.

This suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President’s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.

When you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.

Timeline of Events:
March 2, 2015: The New York Times breaks the story that Clinton used a personal e-mail account while Secretary of State.
March 4, 2015: The Benghazi committee issues a subpoena requiring preservation of all e-mails.
March 7, 2015: Barack Obama states he only learned about the private e-mail server “through news reports” at the same time as everybody.
March 7, 2015: 15:41:16 -0800 (PST) Cheryl Mills writes EMAIL ID 31077 as revealed by Podesta Emails Part 18: “we need to clean this up — he has emails from her — they do not say state.gov.”
March 7, 2015: Hillary Surrogate Terry McCauliffe met with the FBI agent who oversaw the Clinton e-mail case and his wife and promised financial support ($500k+) if she ran for office. — Wall Street Journal
March, 25–31, 2015: Paul Cobetta, a Platte River Networks employee, permanently and irreversibly deletes the email archive using a software called BleachBit likely under orders from Cheryl Mills after receiving advice on Reddit on how to delete e-mails for a “VIP”. The evidence under congressional subpoena is completely destroyed, including the Presidents e-mails.",,,,,,,,,{}
Fake_35-Webpage,Angela Merkel Admits Bringing In Muslim Refugees Was A Big Fat Mistake,"Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.

This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.

The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.

Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”

According to the Daily Mail,

Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said. The leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’

Here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a “living lie.” Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it’s not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they’re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.

Beware, America. Beware.

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America.

We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

“We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.”

Watch below:

Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology. Admittedly, I think I’d be tempted to make a medical “error” or two.",http://freedomdaily.com/disgusting-because-of-hillary-obama-ny-terrorist-will-get-better-treatment-than-us-vets/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3895D4C900000578-3798726-Ahmad_Khan_Rahami_28_was_taken_into_custody_on_Monday_after_a_sh-a-65_1474398076306.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.

This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER.

We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.

Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.

The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.

Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.

Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished.",http://freedomdaily.com/despicable-hillary-wants-put-hero-cop-stopped-mall-terror-attack-business/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hillary-vs-cop.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Fake_38-Webpage,UNFIT! Look What Hillary Needed To Get Up The Stairs At Her Rally Today! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"978 SHARES Facebook Twitter

I don’t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton’s health constantly making headline, but it’s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

•More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either “below average” or “very poor” health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That’s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

•The share of voters who think Clinton’s health is “average” remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either “above average” or “excellent” health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

•Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton’s potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she’s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60’s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ‘looking old’ or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can’t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary’s health. The suspicion isn’t from one particular thing, it’s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady’s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‘confused and needing naps’, of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn’t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone’s arm.



Here’s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don’t see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she’s gasping for air.

Fake_4-Webpage,"HILLARY ON DISABLED CHILDREN During Easter Egg Hunt: ""When are they going to get those f*g ree-tards out of here?"" * 100percentfedUp.com","Dolly Kyle has written a scathing “tell all” book exposing the sickening hidden truth about Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary’s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?

Dolly Kyle – who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated – published the claims about the Clinton couple’s racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.

She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor’s mansion during Bill’s tenure in the Arkansas state house.

Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough.

‘The frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, “When are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?”‘ Dolly writes.

When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‘ignorant hillbillies’.

She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners – unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan.

Hillary didn’t belong in Arkansas but here she was’.

In the governor’s mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.

I…can’t…even.

This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.

I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

It’s going to blow up in his face.

In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings.

Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner.

Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run?

Punchline: The law abiding ones!

I’m so funny.

Fake_41-Webpage,Clinton's Exploited Haiti Earthquake ‘to Steal Billions of Dollars from the Sick and Starving’ ⋆ Freedom Daily,"0 SHARES Facebook Twitter

Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump’s campaign website.

Sansaricq’s statement says:

Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.

The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.

The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer.

Fake_42-Webpage,BOOM! Merkel Admits Flooding Germany With Muslim Refugees,"6.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,

“If I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.”

These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin’s Sunday elections. She also said,

“If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.”

She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.

The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.

Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.

However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.

Merkel stated,

“If people don’t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany’s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.”

Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,

“It is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.”

The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.

This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama’s and Hillary Clinton’s. She is no different which is why many Americans too cannot stand

Fake_43-Webpage,"SICK! Muslim Refugee Beats, Urinates On Pregnant Woman After Seeing What She Has ⋆ Freedom Daily","1.6k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn’t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.

He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren’t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.

Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‘disobedient’ woman. Especially when pregnant.

Quran 4:34 — So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband’s] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of “beat them,” the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.

I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims which he is

Fake_44-Webpage,Republicans Push Bill To Legalize Voter Intimidation To Help Trump In Pennsylvania,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Gitlin said. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”

As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And that’s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

“We’re going to watch Pennsylvania,” Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we’re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion – I really mean this, Pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”

Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!”

In response to Trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

Fake_45-Webpage,Female Muslim-American Olympian Bashes U.S.A. —Goes Off The Hinges About Why America Sucks! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"131.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Well tell us how you really feel.

Normally when a Muslim bashes the USA, you wouldn’t think that they’re an American themselves. Such wasn’t the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad,who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab.

As it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she’s representing.

According to her, as quoted by The Federalist Papers:

[I feel unsafe] all the time. I had someone follow me home from practice and try to report me to police. And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City… I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don’t come even close to things we’ve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It’s ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.”

How terrible – but let’s not pretend that we live in an “Islamophobic” country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.

If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn’t she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer – because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.

She’s not going to be stoned to death in America. She’s not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She’s not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She’s not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.

Fake_46-Webpage,Charlotte Thugs Leaves Cop’s Body With Disgusting Thing They Did... ⋆ Freedom Daily,"4.3k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a “peaceful protest” into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.

Go figure. They can’t even play the race card on this one, but they’ll still wreck a town for no reason.

It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?

Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.

Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn’t listen to police.

That must mean it’s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don’t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.

Madworld News – Rioters swarmed this man’s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It’s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don’t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn’t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.

If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I’d probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they’d be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.

Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They’re the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.

Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.

They’re a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they’re white. They attack people just because they’re white.

They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can’t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.

Based off what I’ve seen so far, I can proudly say F*ck Black Lives Matter and the hoopty they drove in

Fake_47-Webpage,Obama Told Americans That Their Freedom Is Over And,"5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter

President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.

During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.

Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he’s enjoying that Gilligan’s Island by himself.

How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It’s like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.

Fake_48-Webpage,Tebow DISMANTLES national anthem protests in one sentence...BOOM! ⋆ Freedom Daily,"20.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick’s protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, “Tebowing” celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as follows…

“When people have belief in something,” said Tebow, “or conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it’s all about standing for it the right way.’

Keyword is “STANDING” which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He’s a high paid bench player and he’s being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, that’s cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald’s next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And let’s not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming you’re oppressed is really you admitting you’re lazy and don’t want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn’t oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because he’s smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He’s too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

Fake_49-Webpage,Federal Agents Make Massive Discovery at Southern Border… ISIS Is Here ⋆ Freedom Daily,"2.8k SHARES Facebook Twitter

A border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. China didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.

We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.

And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying…

As the Conservative Tribune reported:

Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,” he said. “Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.”

It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that “Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,” Garza explained. “Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.”

We need a border and stronger border security – and there’s only one Presidential candidate willing to help with

Fake_5-Webpage,'Reporters' FLEE When Clintons Get EXPOSED!,"The Haitians in the audience have some newsworthy things to say about their experiences. Too bad The Media (D) didn’t stick around to hear it.

These people LOVED Trump. They cheered for him, he sat quietly as they told their stories.

It was an absolute love-in.

That would have chafed the media badly enough.

But the audience had something ELSE in common. Complaints against the Clintons, who — to hear these people tell it — once they got their money, were never seen again.

It turns out, they’re not very popular for their handling of Haiti.

The have evidence they want to see followed up on. Against the Clintons.

Does any of this sound familiar? Lots of the money sent to ‘Help” Haiti didn’t ever reach the poor people.

They claim it found its way back to Washington Lobbyists. And then to the White House.

Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it.

When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?

There was no news there ‘worth reporting’… nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.

So they left early.

The camera followed them out of the room, scurrying like the rats they are.

Fake_50-Webpage,Australia Voted To Ban Muslims And Liberals Are Pissed,"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.

Oh how wrong they were, and still are.

First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.

The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.

Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:

A new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.

So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist.

Ok, yeah, that sounds logical.

Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.”

Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November.

You can’t make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not.

Then along came video.

This is by far one of the craziest things I’ve ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they’re even better when they’re in the middle of a major road.

Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire.

LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE.

And they’re still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.

Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I’ve watched since the Casey Anthony trial.

What goes through someone’s deplorable brain when they’re thinking – well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let’s just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn.

Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It’s not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it’s a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning.

Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different.

If you see two people about to fight and they’re in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren’t getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand.

That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them.

Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let’s a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it.

No one cares anymore.

Time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on fire.",http://freedomdaily.com/white-men-set-on-fire-by-blacks-media-censored/,http://freedomdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/whites-on-fire.jpg,,http://freedomdaily.com,{'$date':

Fake_52-Webpage,"ALERT: Police Pull Over ‘Islamic Refugee,’ Horrified To See What Was In The Car","We need a border wall. It is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into America.

Law enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.
(via Mad News World)

Police were unable to determine why the woman, described as an “Islamic refugee,” was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.

The plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.

The pipeline identified in the Muslim woman’s plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.

It is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.

A report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.

Judicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.

Congress should approve funding for President Trump’s border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.

Many of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.

If a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.

The only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. Until we do, our country is easy pickings.",,,,,,,,,{}
Fake_53-Webpage,CNN’s Post-Debate Rigged Poll Busted…Here Are The Real Results,"We’re shocked — SHOCKED — to learn that CNN’s bias is so blatant in just about everything they do, not simply in reporting the news.

First came Lester Holt’s unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked Donald Trump’s record and answers while leaving Hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn’t worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn’t bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Not to be outdone, NBC followed up with a similar poll in which there were 14% more Democrats than Republicans.",,,,,,,,,{}
Fake_54-Webpage,"The NFL Told Russell Wilson Not To Speak About His Faith, So He Did Something Fans Couldn't Believe ⋆ Freedom Daily","2.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter

Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.

On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.

For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.

He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.

“In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.”

It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.

Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.

Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root.

So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith…

Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes.

With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious.

Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.

Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?

There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.

Fake_55-Webpage,The Pope Flat Out Called Fox News Type Journalism ‘Terrorism’,"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.

Fake_56-Webpage,"HERE IT IS! The Winner of the First Debate Was Just Announced, And the Winner Is…","775 SHARES Facebook Twitter

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump’s tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton’s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent “winning” results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton’s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let’s not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Fake_57-Webpage,Hillary Thought She Won The Debate. Didn’t Expect This To Happen To Prove Her Wrong.,"Oh Hillary, when will you learn? You never count your chickens before they’re hatched. Also, don’t say you’ve won when you clearly didn’t.

The polls are in from last night’s debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night’s debate.

But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?

According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday’s presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz’s group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN’s group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz’s group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn’t do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump “tanked” when “trying to explain why he questioned Obama’s birthplace for so long.”

But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

After Hillary’s tweet that said she won, America shot her down FAST.

@HillaryClinton The number one trending hashtag in the world is #TrumpWon. You can't delete it like its your damn e-mails. — Anthony Einzig (@AnthonyEinzig) September 27, 2016

@HillaryClinton …you run and hide from media afterwards. — Honky Cartel (@ScottInSC) September 27, 2016

Looks like Hillary has some explaining to do. Some things you just can’t delete.

Fake_58-Webpage,Riot Police DID Shoot Unarmed Charlotte Protester In Head,"7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying – and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: “I didn’t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.”

My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 — Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. — BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

“I didn’t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let’s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot,” Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

“The protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,” Meyer told me almost breathlessly, “I’ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‘hands up, don’t shoot’ and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.”

“After leaving ‘The Epicenter,’ police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful – and that’s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.”

Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, “oh, absolutely.”

Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

“It wasn’t a gunshot,” she told us. “It was much louder. It wasn’t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‘They just shot him’ and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn’t already left, exited.”

At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‘entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.’

CNN reports, “Police say the person was shot by a civilian.”

The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester’s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. — City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police’s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

“I saw the man go down on the pavement,” said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, “It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.”

#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV — Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook – which was also shared via twitter – that, “within 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.”

When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how – with more violence.

Fake_59-Webpage,"ABC Reveals Trump Paid ""Hundreds Of Millions"" By Russian Oligarchs","46.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.”

The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

“I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

Fake_6-Webpage,Bombing Suspect Filed Anti-Muslim Discrimination Lawsuit Against Police – Eagle Rising,"The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims.

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to “selective enforcement” based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.

Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with “baseless” tickets, and that locals said: “Muslims don’t belong here.” Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

Fake_60-Webpage,"New Jersey Moves To Impeach Chris Christie Over ""Bridgegate""","71k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

New Jersey’s despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the “Bridgegate” scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential’s nominee Donald Trump’s transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world’s busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trump’s most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major “conservative” Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump’s benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It’s have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor’s the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration’s bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year’s Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

Fake_61-Webpage,Newsweek Accuses Trump Of Committing A Felony,"11.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.

Trump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here:

Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.” Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn’t— Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to— Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before— Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?” Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

Fake_62-Webpage,Surgeon General warns: Drinking every time Trump lies during debate could result in acute alcohol poisoning,"Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.

Last year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015

The story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.

According to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.

So, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.

So, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.",,,,,,,,,{}
Fake_63-Webpage,Putin's Troll Army Caught Rigging Twitter To Pretend Trump Won,"13.6k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.”

So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

Fake_64-Webpage,Trump Supreme Court Pick Sued By Feds For Racial Discrimination,"13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY

S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

“Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.

Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:

Lead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.

Lead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.”

Lead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE.

Buy Now You probably have all seen the news by now, the explosives detonated in New York City, that was me. Those were just some tests, I know where I have made errors and I will not make the same mistake next time. I did it because I cannot stand society. I cannot live in a world where homosexuals like myself as well as the rest of the LGBTQ+ community are looked down upon by society. It is 2016 and we are still being viewed as mentally ill, sinners, attention seekers, and just plain weirdos in general. I am not going to stand by while under classed and underprivileged people are oppressed. I am not going to stand by while there is inequality in my country such as the racism being seen in white police officers all over the country. I am not going to live in a country where it is OK to have a misogynist, xenophobic, racist Islamophobic, republican candidate running for President of The United States! That’s implying that republicans in general should even be taken seriously as they are all cisgendered privileged white people. This is not the end, this is just the beginning. I will be remembered. I will make a difference. I will eliminate my targets before it is too late.

Someone is lying and it’s just sick that anyone would want to claim this, especially one who didn’t even do it.

Fake_66-Webpage,Donald Trump Goes Off The Deep End–May Be Unfit For Debate ‹ Opposition Report,"

Posted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 25 Sep 2016

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he’s obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He’s constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He’s a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He’s been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to “relax” he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

It’s obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he’s set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he’s simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump’s mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it’s just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Just…what is he talking about? If you’re trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He’s obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all… when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.

I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It’s looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.

From Gateway Pundit:

At Hillary Clinton’s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.

The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.

The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.

Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here… the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump’s rallies are packed with thousands of people… he’s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point.

Between Trump leading in the polls, the enthusiasm factor, Hillary’s health, her corruption and terrorism concerns, it’s beginning to look more and more likely that the Trumpster will be the next president.",http://rightwingnews.com/hillary-clinton-2/secret-video-records-massive-hillary-event-flop/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clinton-4.jpg,Terresa Monroe-hamilton,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474291954000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-HZMqIkGoU,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clinton-4-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Clinton-4.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/hillary-clinton-2/secret-video-records-massive-hillary-event-flop/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton.

This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a “bombing/” CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that — even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary’s wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it.

In the CNN footage, they only showed Clinton responding to a question from a reporter, where she agreed that Trump was “insensitive” for calling the Chelsea bombing a “bombing.” Jake Tapper played the same footage a second time and again criticized Trump for jumping to conclusions. Both times, the network did not air Clinton’s own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter’s question.

Trump was interviewed on Fox and Friends and he held nothing back. “CNN is disgusting and disgraceful,” he declared. “These people are the most dishonest people, CNN is so disgusting and dishonest, and I watch it, it’s so unfair, they call it the Clinton news network. She used the word ‘bombs’ also by the way… I was criticized for calling it correctly – what I said was exactly correct.”

He also pointed the finger at “stupid” leaders going soft on terrorism. “Well it’s a mess and it’s a shame and we’re going to have to be very tough,” he said. “I think we’re going to see a big change over the last couple of days, I think this is something that will happen more and more all over the country.” He explained that “because we’ve been weak, out country’s been weak, we’re letting people in by the thousands and the tens of thousands, and as I’ve been saying you’ve got to stop it.”

Obama was heavily criticized by Trump for his plan to accept over 110,000 Syrian refugees in 2017 — and Hillary wants to make that number even higher, according to Trump. “Hillary Clinton wants to increase what he’s letting in and he’s letting in thousands of thousands of people… they can’t be properly vetted,” said Trump. “He let in over 100,000 additional people and now Hillary Clinton is raising it by 550 per cent… thousands of people are pouring into our country and we have no idea what we’re doing.

Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he’s an entitled whiner. Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area… you know, his culture.

In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‘Muslims don’t belong here’. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.

From April 2009 for two years they allege that they were unfairly targeted for staying open past 10pm despite being permitted to do so. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

The Elizabeth police department allegedly ’embarked on a course to harass, humiliate, retaliate against and force their business to close at 10pm’. The lawsuit claims that the officers told them there was ‘too much crime around here’ and that the area around the restaurant was ‘known for criminal activity’.

The irony of it all is that just 5 years later, Ahmad was arrested for the very same thing he was fighting. Hmmm, it’s not like a person goes from selling fried chicken to building bombs in just 5 years, right?

Fake_7-Webpage,Clinton Foundation Spent 5.7% on Charity; Rest Went to “Salaries” and “Other Expenses” – Eagle Rising,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation – where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners – the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed “good” that the foundation has done over the years.

I don’t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they’re an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization’s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and “other expenses.” The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization’s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as “other expenses,” while the remaining almost $851K was marked as “professional fundraising expenses.” Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more “other expenses” in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Fake_70-Webpage,Obama’s Speech In New York Shocks Americans When He Says THIS About Attacks!,"Obama’s Speech In New York Shocks Americans When He Says THIS About Attacks!

I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance.

He has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.

I’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.

Surely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.

Well apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.

Are you outraged yet?

It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes.

He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.

Critics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour.

But no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that.

Fake_71-Webpage,Bill And Hillary Clinton Have A MAJOR AIDS Scandal!,"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.

Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed “watered down” drugs to third-world countries.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. — The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. — The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. — The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.

This latest report proves that the Clinton Foundation should be SHUT DOWN immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching Bill and Hillary!

Do you think that the Clinton Foundation should be shut down immediately before it continues to harm more and more people around the world?

Fake_72-Webpage,Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don’t end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child’s genitals, so if you’re a parent of a child and you’ve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you’re a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from “intentionally or knowingly touching” the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don’t know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that “prosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.” They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y’all. There’s no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here’s an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority’s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court’s help, Arizona’s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver—out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state’s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona’s parents and caregivers.

Yikes.

But I’m sure it’ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y’all. Because doesn’t government always know best?",http://www.chicksontheright.com/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/?utm_source=RWN&utm_medium=RWN&utm_campaign=RWN,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg,Mockarena Cotr,http://www.chicksontheright.com,{'$date': 1474332562000},,"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0a2fb62ae885c1cdb2a0c69249a9c25a?s=120&d=mm&r=g,http://www.chicksontheright.com/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/?utm_source=RWN&utm_medium=RWN&utm_campaign=RWN#!,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cotrolog-smalll.png,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CotR_banner1-copy-2.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8W3QtpyKy7xuZ.gif,http://rightchicks.staging.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/book-thumb.jpg,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49-812x478.jpg,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg,https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kardashian-jenner-424x250.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-d1x2X8_nNBHjc.gif",https://www.chicksontheright.com/2016/09/19/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/,"{""description"": ""A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court."", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Chicks On The Right"", ""description"": ""A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court."", ""title"": ""Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona - Chicks On The Right"", ""locale"": ""en_US"", ""image"": {""width"": 812, ""identifier"": ""https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg"", ""height"": 550}, ""url"": ""https://www.chicksontheright.com/2016/09/19/changing-your-babys-diaper-is-now-a-sex-crime-in-arizona/"", ""type"": ""article""}, ""twitter"": {""image"": ""https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg"", ""description"": ""A terrible law just got upheld by a terrible Supreme Court."", ""card"": ""summary"", ""title"": ""Changing Your Baby's Diaper Is Now A Sex Crime In Arizona - Chicks On The Right""}, ""robots"": ""noodp"", ""article"": {""publisher"": ""https://www.facebook.com/ChicksOnTheRight/"", ""section"": ""Constitution"", ""tag"": ""felony"", ""published_time"": ""2016-09-19T20:49:22-04:00"", ""author"": ""https://www.facebook.com/ChicksOnTheRight/""}, ""viewport"": ""width=device-width, initial-scale=1""}"
Fake_73-Webpage,Michelle Obama NOT Leaving The White House – Hillary Clinton Has Terrifying New Role For Her!?!?,"Michelle Obama NOT Leaving The White House – Hillary Clinton Has Terrifying New Role For Her!?!?

The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill. I was done with them after the first few days of the Barack Obama Presidency, but it would appear that Hillary Clinton has some roles for the President and First Lady after her coronation election.

What exactly is First Lady Michelle Obama’s legacy? Trying to force our growing children to eat like anorexic bunnies and having scientific evaluations prove that her school lunch program is a bunch of crap? Or perhaps it will be the infamous “for the first time in my life I’m proud of my country.” I personally will remember her for strong hashtag activism and her “#BringBackOurGirls” sign.

But why remember her when one of the Presidential nominees promises to bring her into her administration?

*insert mechanical applause here*

But what would her role be? What is she even qualified to do?

It’s not hard to figure out what Hillary Clinton wants her to do when you remember that Clinton believes that the government should have a major role in bringing up YOUR children. If you doubt that, read this tweet:

I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?

For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her “faith” and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.

Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.

Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. “I do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,” she said. “I have a rest-of-my-life horizon.”

This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the “I don’t like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas” vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.

Either way, I’m absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children. The government is not one gigantic parental unit, nor should it be viewed as one. That is an extremely dangerous idea to have, as nothing good has EVER come out of complete government control over the average citizen.",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474400493000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/flotusclinton.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/composite_14743119289879-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/michelle-obama-not-leaving-white-house-hillary-clinton-terrifying-new-role/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""The idea that I might have to spend the next 4 years continuing to cover the Obamas is actually making me a little ill.

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with ‘Clinton’ in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this… the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I’m betting that they did.

Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.

“This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

“The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation’s aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.” “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s charity have not severed ties with them either.

Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant.

Fake_75-Webpage,BREAKING: Judge DEMANDS Release Of Clinton’s Security Training Files – She Has 5 Days…,"BREAKING: Judge DEMANDS Release Of Clinton’s Security Training Files – She Has 5 Days…

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that’s no joke. They shouldn’t be cleared to clean a toilet there.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn’t do. It’s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it… I wouldn’t hold my breath.

From The Daily Caller:

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department’s motion to dismiss TheDCNF’s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF’s request to depose State Department officials. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don’t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail… guess we just aren’t the ‘right people’.

Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said “Judge Leon’s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department’s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.” I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It’s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‘corruption’.

State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the “courses were not completed” by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh.

Fake_76-Webpage,Networks Confirm They Will Not Be Fact-Checking Donald Trump In Any Way,"There’s already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable – except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics …. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator … to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trump’s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it’s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to “shine” at the debate if she hopes to “win.” This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, it’s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.

Fake_77-Webpage,"Decades-Old Clinton Friend Comes Forward, Says She Knows What's Happening to Hillary","Advertisement - story continues below

One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state.

Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.”

“Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.”

Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.

These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.

“That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States.

Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.

Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.

“She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said.

This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

Fake_78-Webpage,"‘We Don’t Adapt To Your Culture, You Adapt To Ours’","America needs to get with the program when it comes to immigration. Yes, we are “a nation of immigrants,” the proverbial “melting pot.” More importantly we are UNITED STATES of AMERICA.

There should be no more of this each to their own garbage when it comes to how immigrants want to live their lives. If they want to stick with their own programs then they should have stayed put in their countries of origin.

(Via JewsNews) Quebec mayor gives Muslim ‘refugees’ a little piece of his mind by spilling the truth that Canadians don’t adapt to them, it’s the other way around.

” MUSLIMS MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MUST ADAPT TO CANADA, ITS CUSTOMS, ITS TRADITIONS, ITS WAY OF LIFE, BECAUSE IT WAS THE COUNTRY THAT WAS CHOSEN TO EMIGRATE. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT THEY MUST INTEGRATE AND LEARN TO LIVE IN CANADA. NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE TO BE FOR THEM TO CHANGE THEIR LIFESTYLE, NOT THE CANADIANS WHO SO GENEROUSLY WELCOMED THEM. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT CANADIANS ARE NOT RACIST OR XENOPHOBIC. WE ACCEPT MANY IMMIGRANTS, IN MANY COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT CULTURES AND RELIGIONS, CONTRADICTING TO MANY MUSLIM COUNTRIES WHICH DO NOT ACCEPT IMMIGRANTS NON-MUSLIMS. FOR THIS REASON, THE CANADIANS ARE NOT WILLING TO GIVE UP THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR CULTURE. FINALLY, THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN CANADA, WITH ITS JUDEO-CHRISTIAN ROOTS, CHRISTMAS TREES, CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS, RELIGION MUST REMAIN IN THE PRIVATE SPHERE. THE MUNICIPALITY OF DURVAL HAS THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY CONCESSIONS TO ISLAM AND SHARIA LAW. FOR MUSLIMS, WHO ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE CANADIAN CULTURE AND RELIGION AND DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN CANADA, THERE ARE 57 BEAUTIFUL MUSLIM COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, MOST OF THEM UNDER-POPULATED AND READY TO RECEIVE THEM WITH OPEN ARMS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA LAW. IF YOU LEFT HIS COUNTRY TO COME TO CANADA, AND NOT TO A MUSLIM COUNTRY, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THAT LIFE IS BETTER IN CANADA THAN IN OTHER PLACES. HELP YOURSELF TO THE QUESTION, JUST ONCE: WHY IS IT BETTER HERE IN CANADA THAT WHERE IT COMES FROM.

It boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives. This is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans.

While most Americans are perplexed as to how a foreign entity could trump American law on our own sovereign soil, Texas isn’t waiting for the courts to intervene on the issue, but rather pass immediate legislation baring any attempt to institute Sharia law within the American Judicial System

Because Muslims cannot eat a particular meal, should mean they should bring their own. The few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. Adopt it, or don’t. Just do block others from it. Boom. There it is. AND, that is the philosophy we ought to have.

What do you do if you’re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you’re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

Step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in.

Step two is up to you. Do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? Do you call the police and wait.

This guy had another idea entirely and it worked like a charm.

A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.

That seems very bizarre considering that we’ve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?

Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.

While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.

The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.

This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through?",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,Sierra Marlee,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474580005000},,"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b908b63c4d23dddd81cbb8876ad3b926?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/38AE9F0800000578-3801796-image-a-77_1474541057817-620x354-890x395_c.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/white-guy-walled-car-blacklivesmatter-protesters-see-hes-brandishing-scatter/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""What do you do if you\u2019re sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you\u2019re surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

Fake_8-Webpage,The Black Sphere with Kevin Jackson,"Chicago Environmentalist Scumbags

Leftists are in constant contradiction, like the Chicago environmentalist scumbags.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn’t impact Liberals personally, they remain content.

Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it’s time for them decry law enforcement.

Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is “thrilled” to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago’s South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.

So much for “white privilege,” huh George?!

The Chicago environmentalist scumbags’ decision contradicts their own charter.

The Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let’s see; wrecking the environment for the black man’s library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

Pretty much an environmental “no brainer,” unless you’re dealing with hypocrite Liberals, and crooked Chicago

Fake_80-Webpage,Obama: “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.”,"This is a true story. General Stanley McChrystal was the Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan and he had frequent disagreements on the conduct of the war with his Commander-in-Chief.

At one point McChrystal was called into the Oval Office and he knew his Army career was about to be over.

When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.

Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve. He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance.

Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again.

Good job General McChrystal. I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line. You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.

Fake_81-Webpage,SURPRISE! 70% Of Charlotte RIOTERS Are Not From There – Guess What That Means… [VIDEO],"SURPRISE! 70% Of Charlotte RIOTERS Are Not From There – Guess What That Means… [VIDEO]

Imagine that… at least 70% of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina were bused in. They had out of state IDs. Looks like it was well planned. I know here in Tulsa, hubby had to leave work early yesterday. We got word that Black Lives Matter was busing people into Tulsa as well. In our case, things stayed pretty peaceful fortunately. They weren’t so lucky in Charlotte. The head of the police union there came right out and said these were professional criminals that were brought in.

This is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning. Wait for something to happen that causes outrage. Use the black community as useful tools for your agenda. Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them… Tulsa, not so much.

From Louder with Crowder:

Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there’s a riot like this, it’s all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they’re even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that’s not sarcasm. Shut up. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now Take it away CNN… “This is not Charlotte that’s out here. These are outside entities that are coming in and causing these problems. These are not protestors, these are criminals.” “We’ve got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They’re not coming from Charlotte.”

I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It’s not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda.

These people don’t care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That’s their goal… it’s part of wanting to burn all of America down. It’s what communists do – they want their revolution and race wars and they want them now.",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/surprise-70-charlotte-rioters-not-guess-means-video/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bus.png,Terresa Monroe-hamilton,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474651120000},https://www.youtube.com/embed/ag5lEfilclE,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bus.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bus-890x395_c.png,http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d35b77ff6c39007151d514afeb3a2758?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/black-lives-matter/surprise-70-charlotte-rioters-not-guess-means-video/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""Imagine that\u2026 at least 70% of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina were bused in.

Fake_82-Webpage,Hillary's DEAD!?!? Brand New Theory Has Serious PROOF,"Hillary Clinton’s health is the top issue in the Presidential campaign. Once considered a “conspiracy theory,” Americans now see that Hillary Clinton suffers from serious problems, including neurological diseases.

After her September 11th collapse and fainting, even the pro-Hillary media can’t hide the truth.

Now, expert Clif Hite (below) comes up with the most compelling theory about Hillary Clinton’s health yet, and you haven’t heard it before. He believes Hillary has died, and is replaced by multiple body doubles and CGI images. If true, this is the biggest coverup in the history of American politics. What a bombshell!:



As BeforeItsNews reports:

Note: Russian Intel is using my video to prove they used Green Screen in Greensboro! It’s all fake folks! You’ll see my video below. The Russians who track Hillary say she never left Chelsea’s apartment and she’s using doubles! Also check out the part where Russia shows the emails proving Hillary was in a secret plane crash and hurt badly! At first they laugh at Sorcha Faal’s report but then admit it’s “credible”! Huge info here! Stew Webb and Tom Heneghan reported on this plane crash when it happened!

Do you believe that Hillary Clinton was injured or killed in a crash, and replaced by CGI?

Fake_83-Webpage,EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down,"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans’ PAC To Take Trump Down

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.”

Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.”

The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.”

Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him:

Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.

The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right? O’Brien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called “Tell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans.” The petition is probably what grabbed Soros attention to get O’Brien to start the shallow PAC. With all of these shell groups being created solely to destroy Trump and funded by Soros, do you think that Trump stands a chance against the Left?",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/exposed-soros-funding-fake-veterans-pac-to-take-trump-down/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/soros-trump.jpg,Tiffiny Ruegner,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1474871998000},,"http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/soros-trump.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/soros-trump-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/145.thumbnail-144x144.png,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/exposed-soros-funding-fake-veterans-pac-to-take-trump-down/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros.

Fake_84-Webpage,OUTRAGE! Obama Spends $770M Dollars In Tax Payer Money To Renovate Mosques Over Seas… [VIDEO],"OUTRAGE! Obama Spends $770M Dollars In Tax Payer Money To Renovate Mosques Over Seas… [VIDEO]

CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he’s still doing it. He’s diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran… why he gives ISIS a pass… why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.

Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office… it’s where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques… we are funding their wars as well, even against America.

From TruthFeed:

“You Didn’t Build That”…Oh Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas — outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. × 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The United States ‘investment’ of millions to refurbish mosques as a ‘good-will effort’ in Muslim countries has upset many. “We are spending money we don’t have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,” said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.

Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can’t make ends meet and our country can’t pay its bills… yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.

The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas – something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: “Fighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.” What bovine excrement.

Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic.

Fake_85-Webpage,BOOM! Marines Send TERRORISTS Scathing Message [VIDEO],"BOOM! Marines Send TERRORISTS Scathing Message [VIDEO]

There’s a reason that it’s called terrorism. It’s because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.

While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people’s hearts, Marines aren’t bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don’t have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they’re rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists’ faces.

A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:

Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn’t be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?

And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they’re ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we’re not afraid, then the terrorists lose.

Sorry, ISIS. Game over.

The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.

Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children.

“Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”

Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting.

Fake_87-Webpage,BREAKING: Steps to FORCE FBI Director Comey to Resign In Process – Hearing Decides His Fate Sept 28,"BREAKING: Steps to FORCE FBI Director Comey to Resign In Process – Hearing Decides His Fate Sept 28

The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.”

DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.

Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing; he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.

Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.

How loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her?

The Saudi deputy crown prince told reporters in June the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has funded 20% of Hillary Clinton’s campaign. She’s taking money from a stone cold enemy and that’s not the only one by any means. You do not consort or take money from those who intend to destroy your country… period. That goes for Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. It also includes any dictatorship or communist strongman. We never learn our lesson, do we?

Now it comes to light that Saudi Arabia is selling ISIS sex slaves off to the highest bidder at public auctions. Iraqis, Syrians, Saudis and WESTERNERS all bought slaves at the auction. This is monstrous and going on right out in the open. It should be stopped cold… whatever it takes. Britain needs to stop selling the Saudis weapons and we need to pull our politicians out of the Saudi bedroom and back home. They are killing us and enslaving women and children. How can we silently stand by while this evil goes on?

Fake_89-Webpage,Cavuto Just Exposed Lester Holt's Lies During Debate,"Advertisement - story continues below

The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.

NBC’s Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to “fact-check” him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.

In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported.

Advertisement - story continues below

Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war.

After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn’t all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in — he had his reservations.

“You know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn’t talk. I mean we have to, you know, it’s sort of like either do it or don’t do it,” Trump said.

“Well, he’s (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn’t be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he’s under a lot of pressure,” said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.

You can see it here:

Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged “support” for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.

Advertisement - story continues below

It shouldn’t surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump’s name.

Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

Fake_9-Webpage,"The AP, In 2004, Said Your Boy Obama Was BORN In This Particular Country","Well THAT’S Weird. If the Birther movement is racist… does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?

What if that person is … Obama?

Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ““Kenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate” That was June 2004.

Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.

It’s still out there on the internet. Here’s a screen capture:

Here’s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.

And the link to the original.

That’s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.

That was Obama’s publicist. Here’s the quote:

Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama’s then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as “born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.” The booklet, which was distributed to “business colleagues” in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama’s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White–which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.

If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?

If his birth in America is valid — as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‘foreigner’ card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of … whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.

Because if That WASN’T a lie… then something else MUST be. That ‘something else’ being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency.

The quote can be read in context at Breitbart.",http://clashdaily.com/2016/09/dear-cnn-ap-2004-said-boy-obama-born-particular-country/?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=facebook.com&utm_campaign=lasmpfb,http://clashdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-18-at-10.44.25-AM-1200x630.png,"Rich Witmer,Doug Giles",http://clashdaily.com,{'$date': 1474207108000},,"http://clashdaily.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/113148-featured-330x120.jpg,http://clashdaily.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-23-at-2.12.08-AM.jpg,http://clashdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-18-at-10.44.25-AM-1200x630.png,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif,http://clashdaily.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/111435-featured-330x120.jpg,http://clashdaily.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-11-at-10.10.13-AM.png,http://clashdaily.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/clash-logo-new-large2d.png,http://clashdaily.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/113107-featured-330x120.jpg,http://clashdaily.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-18-at-10.42.06-AM-770x548.png,http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1,http://clashdaily.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/113125-featured-330x120.jpg,http://clashdaily.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-18-at-11.01.07-AM-770x689.png,http://clashdaily.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/113009-featured-330x120.jpg,http://clashdaily.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/113012-featured-330x120.jpg,http://clashdaily.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-22-at-2.07.16-PM.jpg,http://clashdaily.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/109553-featured-330x120.jpg,http://clashdaily.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fathers-day-hp.jpg",http://clashdaily.com/2016/09/dear-cnn-ap-2004-said-boy-obama-born-particular-country/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""Clash Daily"", ""description"": ""Well THAT'S Weird.

Fake_90-Webpage,People Noticed Something Odd About Hillary's Outfit,"

There’s a lot to be discussed about last night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One thing that has baffled many is how Hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn’t cough or reach for water once.

Well, this twitter user might have an answer. Do you see it?

I think we all know why #TrumpWon pic.twitter.com/nwZRxvkX81 — USA For Trump 2016 (@USAforTrump2016) September 27, 2016

This wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her pantsuit?

There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now.

There is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!

The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?

Twitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?

It certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.

Fox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.”

While we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”

Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”

Then Woods added:

“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.”

Of course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.

Some claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights. We’ll let you be the judge.",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/people-noticed-something-odd-hillarys-outfit-debate-last-night/,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hillary-earpiece.jpg,Lisa Smith,http://rightwingnews.com,{'$date': 1475010040000},,"http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3728144c20aefded76b46c098740761f?s=96&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hillary-earpiece-890x395_c.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343804-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/080916earpiece-1.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-214x123.jpg,https://www.facebook.com/tr?ev=6026286623931&cd[value]=0.00&cd[currency]=USD&noscript=1,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-90x90.jpg,http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RS38vHsezmL8w.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343798-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-27-13_40_13-Was-Hillary-Wearing-an-Earpiece-During-Last-Nights-Presidential-Forum_-»-Alex-J.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/themes/rightwingnews-theme/images/loading.gif,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdev-content-ad/assets/book-ad.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343783-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/CtXQpjjWEAEMHmu.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343754-featured-214x123.jpg,http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/3728144c20aefded76b46c098740761f?s=32&d=mm&r=g,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343802-featured-90x90.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/343814-featured-214x123.jpg,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-27-13_39_52-Was-Hillary-Wearing-an-Earpiece-During-Last-Nights-Presidential-Forum_-»-Alex-J.png,http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Hillary-earpiece.jpg,http://www.rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rightwingnews_logo.png",http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/people-noticed-something-odd-hillarys-outfit-debate-last-night/,"{""googlebot"": ""noimageindex"", ""og"": {""site_name"": ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", ""description"": ""There\u2019s a lot that could be discussed about last night\u2019s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that\u2019s not the main concern right now.
